# Windows-10-Update-Notification-Blocker
Disable the large *You have pending updates* notification that minimises applications, and terrorises gamers everywhere.

Simply download the file, and run as administrator to disable the popups. 

If you wish to re-enable the notifications (for whatever reason), simply remove the *rem* comment tags before the individual lines
in the second block of code, and add the *rem* comment tag to each line of the first block.
